p1-TarynNicoleJones-AccountSecurity standup #5

## Accomplishments

- reviewed Day 4 material for Week 4 with batch and make a Markdown file collectively from collaboration in Google Doc
- researched Information Security
- started Udacity Intro to Cloud Computing for better background AWS and what it does
- started Docker course on RevPro for increased insight; already confortable to proceed

## Issues
- given time frame vs. various program on-ramping
  - falling slightly behind Mehrab's pace. had tutoring yesterday evening so did not have chance to implement day's recording (missed coding steps) 
- lack of Spring, and Reactor Netty knowledge/ implementation
- Mehrab thinks project scope too complex and does not fit project type (info from database)
  - not sure entirely what that means, since I don't fully understand each necessary technologies for project

## Future Work
- accomplish just the 3 simple security measures
- figure out how to add all the dependencies and how to utilize
- **DO NOT IMPLEMENT OR ASPIRE FOR INCREASINGLY COMPLEX CODE UNTIL BASE CODE IS WORKING AND COMPLETE**
