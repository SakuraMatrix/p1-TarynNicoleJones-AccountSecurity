p1-TarynNicoleJones-AccountSecurity standup #3 and 4

(8/10/21 - 8/11/21)

## Accomplishments
- Tam helped me fixed broken registry issue, by showing me what forking does from parent to child directores
- reviewed QC coding challenge questions with batch
- reviewed Day 1, Day 2, and Day 3 material for Week 4 with batch and make a Markdown file collectively from collaboration in Google Doc
  - made pull request to merge to docs on SakuraMatrix
- feeling stonger in Java since completing Udacity Intro to Java and Java OOP, Hackerank problems, and SoloLearn practice
- researched Information Security
- started Udacity Intro to Cloud Computing for better background AWS and what it does
- started Docker course on RevPro for increased insight; already confortable to proceed

## Issues
- ~~link from individual vs. team github repository gone (will resolve even w/ brute force on Mon./Tues.)~~
- ~~still gaining skills in Java as OOP~~
- given time frame vs. various program on-ramping
  - falling slightly behind Mehrab's pace. had tutoring yesterday evening so did not have chance to implement day's recording (missed coding steps) 
- lack of ~~AWS, Cassandra,~~ Spring, and Reactor Netty knowledge/ implementation
- Mehrab thinks project scope too complex and does not fit project type (info from database)
  - not sure entirely what that means, since I don't fully understand each necessary technologies for project

## Future Work
- ~~keep growing skills in Java and other programs with external practice sites~~
- accomplish just the 3 simple security measures
- figure out how to add all the dependencies and how to utilize
- **DO NOT IMPLEMENT OR ASPIRE FOR INCREASINGLY COMPLEX CODE UNTIL BASE CODE IS WORKING AND COMPLETE**
